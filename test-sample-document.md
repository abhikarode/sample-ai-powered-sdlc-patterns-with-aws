# Sample Test Document for Knowledge Base Sync Monitoring

## Overview
This is a test document to verify that the Knowledge Base synchronization monitoring system is working correctly.

## Testing Strategy
The monitoring system should:
1. Detect when this document is uploaded to S3
2. Trigger Knowledge Base data source synchronization
3. Monitor the ingestion job status
4. Update document metadata in DynamoDB
5. Handle any failures with retry logic
6. Publish CloudWatch metrics

## Expected Behavior
When this document is processed:
- Status should change from 'pending' to 'ingesting' to 'synced'
- CloudWatch metrics should be published
- The document should become searchable in the Knowledge Base

## Test Completion
If you can find this document through Knowledge Base queries, the monitoring system is working correctly.
