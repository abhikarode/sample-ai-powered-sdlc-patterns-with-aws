# Current Test Document - August 12, 2025

## Purpose
This document is created on August 12, 2025 to test the Knowledge Base ingestion process.

## AWS Lambda Information
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging.

## Key Features
- **Event-driven execution**: Lambda functions are triggered by events from other AWS services
- **Automatic scaling**: Lambda automatically scales your application by running code in response to each trigger
- **Pay-per-use pricing**: You pay only for the compute time you consume
- **Multiple runtime support**: Supports Node.js, Python, Java, C#, Go, Ruby, and custom runtimes

## Use Cases
1. **Data processing**: Process files as they are uploaded to Amazon S3
2. **Real-time stream processing**: Process streaming data from Amazon Kinesis
3. **Web applications**: Build serverless web applications using Lambda with API Gateway
4. **IoT backends**: Process IoT device data and respond to device events

## Testing Knowledge Base Integration
This document should be ingested into the Knowledge Base and available for chat queries about AWS Lambda.
