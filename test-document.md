# AWS Lambda Best Practices

## Performance Optimization
- Use appropriate memory allocation (128MB to 10GB)
- Minimize cold start times by keeping functions warm
- Use connection pooling for database connections
- Implement efficient error handling and retry logic

## Security Best Practices
- Use IAM roles with least privilege principle
- Enable AWS X-Ray for tracing and monitoring
- Encrypt environment variables containing sensitive data
- Validate all input parameters

## Cost Optimization
- Right-size memory allocation based on actual usage
- Use Provisioned Concurrency for predictable workloads
- Monitor and optimize function duration
- Consider using ARM-based Graviton2 processors

## Development Best Practices
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibility
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper logging with structured logs
- Use AWS SDK v3 for better performance
- Handle timeouts gracefully

## Monitoring and Observability
- Set up CloudWatch alarms for errors and duration
- Use AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing
- Implement custom metrics for business logic
- Monitor cold start frequency and duration
