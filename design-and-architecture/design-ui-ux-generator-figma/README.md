# UI/UX Generator with Amazon Bedrock

![UI/UX Generator](docs/images/banner.png)

A powerful application that leverages Amazon Bedrock's AI capabilities to generate UI/UX designs from text descriptions. This tool helps designers and developers quickly create mockups, detailed specifications, and Figma component descriptions.

## Features

- **AI-Powered UI Mockup Generation**: Create visual mockups from text descriptions using Amazon Nova Canvas
- **Batch Image Generation**: Generate 2-4 variations in a single optimized API call to avoid throttling
- **Tabbed Interface**: Each generated variation gets its own tab with dedicated specifications
- **Per-Image UI/UX Specifications**: Generate individual UI descriptions for each variation using Claude 3 Haiku
- **Per-Image Figma Component Specifications**: Get precise component specifications for each variation with exact dimensions, colors, typography, and auto layout settings
- **Responsive Design Considerations**: AI-generated designs include responsive design recommendations
- **Accessibility Guidelines**: Built-in accessibility considerations in generated specifications
- **Smart Model Fallback**: Automatic fallback from Claude 3 Haiku to Claude 3 Opus if needed

## Architecture

### Using the Deployed Application

After deploying to AWS with CDK:

1. Open your browser and navigate to the CloudFront URL provided in the CDK output
2. Use the application as described above

## Example Prompts

- "Create a modern e-commerce product page with image gallery, product details, pricing, and add to cart functionality"
- "Design a dashboard for monitoring IoT devices with real-time status updates, charts, and alert notifications"
- "Create a mobile app login screen with social login options, forgot password functionality, and biometric authentication"

## Deployment

### AWS CDK Deployment

This project includes an AWS CDK deployment that sets up the following infrastructure:

![AWS Architecture](docs/images/ui-generator-aws-architecture.png)

- **Frontend**: Hosted on S3 and served through CloudFront
- **Backend**: Deployed as a Lambda function behind API Gateway
- **Security**: IAM roles with least privilege principle

To deploy the application to AWS:

```bash
# Navigate to the CDK directory
cd cdk

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the CDK project
npm run build

# Deploy to AWS
cdk deploy
```

After deployment, the CDK will output the CloudFront URL where your application is available.

### CloudFront Cache Invalidation

When you update your frontend code and redeploy, CloudFront may continue to serve cached versions of your files. To ensure users see the latest version, you need to invalidate the CloudFront cache:

```bash
# Using AWS CLI
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"
```

Alternatively, you can use the AWS Console:
1. Go to the CloudFront console
2. Select your distribution
3. Go to the "Invalidations" tab
4. Create a new invalidation with the path pattern "/*"

Users can also perform a hard refresh in their browser (Shift+Refresh) to bypass their local cache.

For more details, see the [CDK README](cdk/README.md).

### Architecture

The application uses a serverless architecture on AWS with the following components:

![AWS Architecture Diagram](docs/images/ui-generator-aws-architecture.png)

1. **Backend (Python on AWS Lambda)**
   - Serverless API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway
   - Direct integration with AWS Bedrock services
   - Optimized for performance and reliability
   - Stateless design for scalability

2. **Frontend (React)**
   - Modern UI built with React and Material UI
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile
   - Real-time preview of generated designs
   - Markdown rendering for specifications

3. **AWS Services**
   - **Lambda**: Hosts the serverless backend application
   - **API Gateway**: Provides RESTful API endpoints
   - **S3**: Stores the frontend static files
   - **CloudFront**: Delivers the frontend and proxies API requests
   - **IAM**: Manages permissions and roles
   - **Bedrock**: Provides AI models for UI generation

4. **Architecture Flow**
   - User accesses the CloudFront URL
   - Static content (HTML, JS, CSS) is served from the S3 bucket
   - API requests from the frontend go to CloudFront
   - CloudFront routes `/api/*` requests to API Gateway
   - API Gateway forwards requests to the Lambda function
   - Lambda executes the serverless handler code
   - The Lambda function processes the request using Bedrock services
   - Response flows back through Lambda â†’ API Gateway â†’ CloudFront â†’ User

5. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/generate-mockup`: Generates UI mockups using Bedrock
   - `/api/generate-description`: Generates UI descriptions
   - `/api/generate-components`: Generates Figma component specifications
   - `/api/check-bedrock-access`: Checks access to Bedrock models
   - `/api/assets/{filename}`: Serves generated assets
   - `/api/health`: Health check endpoint

## Security Considerations

- The application uses AWS IAM for authentication and authorization
- All API endpoints are protected with proper CORS configuration
- Environment variables are used for sensitive information
- Input validation is implemented to prevent injection attacks
- File paths are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Security headers are added to all responses
- Bedrock permissions are scoped to specific actions

### Security Best Practices for Deployment

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for production deployments
2. **Restrict API Access**: In production, restrict the CORS `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to specific domains
3. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Configure API Gateway with rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. **Enable CloudTrail**: Enable AWS CloudTrail to monitor API calls
5. **Regular Audits**: Regularly audit IAM permissions and remove unused roles
6. **Monitor CloudWatch Logs**: Set up alerts for suspicious activity in CloudWatch Logs

### Security

See CONTRIBUTING for more information.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 502 Bad Gateway Errors
- **Cause**: Lambda function timeout or error
- **Solution**: Check CloudWatch logs for errors, increase Lambda timeout or memory

#### CloudFront Caching Issues
- **Cause**: CloudFront serving old versions of files
- **Solution**: Invalidate the CloudFront cache or perform a hard refresh

#### Bedrock Model Access
- **Cause**: Missing access to required Bedrock models
- **Solution**: Request access to the models in the AWS Bedrock console

#### CORS Errors
- **Cause**: Incorrect CORS configuration
- **Solution**: Check the CORS settings in API Gateway and CloudFront
