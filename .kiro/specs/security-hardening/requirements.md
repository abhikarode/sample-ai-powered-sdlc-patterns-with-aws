# Security Hardening Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the security hardening requirements for the AI Assistant Knowledge Base project based on the comprehensive security scan findings. The focus is on addressing critical and high-severity vulnerabilities to ensure the application meets enterprise security standards before production deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Input Validation and Sanitization

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want all user inputs to be properly validated and sanitized, so that injection attacks and malformed data processing are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Lambda function receives an API Gateway event THEN the system SHALL validate the event structure using Zod schemas
2. WHEN user input is processed THEN the system SHALL sanitize all string inputs to remove potentially dangerous characters
3. WHEN JSON data is parsed THEN the system SHALL validate the structure and data types before processing
4. WHEN file uploads are processed THEN the system SHALL validate file types, sizes, and content
5. WHEN chat messages are submitted THEN the system SHALL validate message length, content, and format
6. WHEN admin operations are performed THEN the system SHALL validate all operation parameters and user permissions

### Requirement 2: Secure Logging and Information Disclosure Prevention

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want sensitive information to be excluded from logs, so that credentials and PII are not exposed in CloudWatch logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lambda functions log events THEN the system SHALL exclude authorization tokens, user credentials, and PII from logs
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed errors server-side only and return generic error messages to clients
3. WHEN API requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log only non-sensitive request metadata
4. WHEN debugging information is needed THEN the system SHALL use structured logging with configurable log levels
5. WHEN logs are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt CloudWatch logs at rest

### Requirement 3: CORS and Cross-Site Security

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want CORS to be properly configured with specific origins, so that cross-site request forgery and data exfiltration attacks are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API Gateway CORS is configured THEN the system SHALL restrict origins to specific trusted domains only
2. WHEN CORS preflight requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate the requesting origin
3. WHEN API responses include CORS headers THEN the system SHALL not use wildcard (*) for Access-Control-Allow-Origin
4. WHEN cookies are used THEN the system SHALL implement SameSite attributes
5. WHEN cross-origin requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper CSRF protection

### Requirement 4: Authentication and Authorization Hardening

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want authentication and authorization to be properly secured, so that unauthorized access is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OPTIONS methods are configured THEN the system SHALL require authentication for sensitive endpoints
2. WHEN admin operations are performed THEN the system SHALL validate user roles and permissions
3. WHEN JWT tokens are processed THEN the system SHALL validate token structure, expiration, and signature
4. WHEN user sessions are managed THEN the system SHALL implement proper session timeout and refresh logic
5. WHEN password policies are enforced THEN the system SHALL require minimum
