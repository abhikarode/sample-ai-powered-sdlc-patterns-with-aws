# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-powered software development assistant is a comprehensive system that enables development teams to ask questions about development guidelines, SOPs, and team knowledge through natural language processing. The system leverages Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for document ingestion, vector storage, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), providing instant, intelligent answers with secure authentication, document management, and real-time chat interface.

## System Overview

The system serves six primary personas:
- **System Administrator/Knowledge Manager**: Manages the knowledge base, uploads and organizes documents for all team members, controls access permissions
- **Software Developers (Junior/Senior)**: Quick access to coding standards and best practices
- **Solution Architects**: Access to architectural patterns and design guidelines  
- **Project Managers**: Understanding project requirements and process documentation
- **DevOps Engineers**: Access to deployment procedures and infrastructure guidelines
- **QA Engineers**: Access to testing procedures and quality standards
