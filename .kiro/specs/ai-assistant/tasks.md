## Development Guidelines

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Methodology
**FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENT**: Every task must follow the Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle:

#### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle for Each Task
1. **RED Phase**: Write failing tests first
   - Define expected behavior through tests
   - Test against real AWS services (no mocking)
   - Verify tests fail as expected
   - Document test scenarios and edge cases

2. **GREEN Phase**: Write minimal code to pass tests
   - Implement simplest solution that makes tests pass
   - Focus on functionality over optimization
   - Deploy to real AWS infrastructure for testing
   - Validate all tests pass against deployed services

3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Improve code quality while maintaining tests
   - Optimize performance and maintainability
   - Improve error handling and edge cases
   - Enhance security and best practices
   - Ensure all tests continue to pass

#### TDD Task Structure
Each task follows this pattern:
- **RED**: Write failing tests for the desired functionality
- **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass
- **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green
- **DEPLOY & VALIDATE**: Test against real AWS infrastructure

### Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base Architecture
- **MANDATORY**: Use Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for all document processing and RAG operations
- Eliminate custom embedding generation, vector storage, and document chunking code
- Use RetrieveAndGenerate API for all chat functionality
- Leverage Knowledge Base data source synchronization for document ingestion
- Monitor ingestion jobs and handle Knowledge Base-specific error scenarios

### AWS-Only Development and Testing
- All development and testing must be performed on AWS infrastructure
- No local mocking or simulation - use real AWS services for validation
- Each task must be deployed and tested on AWS before marking complete
- Integration testing happens through actual AWS service interactions
- **CRITICAL**: All tests must run against deployed CloudFront URL (https://diaxl2ky359mj.cloudfront.net)

### Terraform MCP Tool Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: Use Terraform MCP tools for ALL Infrastructure as Code tasks
- **AWS Profile**: Always use `--profile aidlc_main` for all AWS operations in this project
- Research AWS resources using `mcp_awslabsterraform_mcp_server_SearchAwsProviderDocs` before implementation
- Execute all Terraform commands using `mcp_awslabsterraform_mcp_server_ExecuteTerraformCommand` with `aws_region: "us-west-2"`
- Run security scans using `mcp_awslabsterraform_mcp_server_RunCheckovScan` on all configurations
- Never use AWS CDK, CloudFormation, or direct AWS CLI for infrastructure deployment

### Playwright MCP Testing Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: All UI and end-to-end tests MUST use Playwright MCP server tools
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: React Testing Library, Jest DOM, Enzyme, Cypress, Puppeteer are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
- Use `mcp_playwright_browser_*` tools for all browser automation and testing
- Tests must run against deployed AWS infrastructure only - no localhost testing
- All tests must validate real user workflows from start to finish

### Task Dependencies
- Tasks are ordered to build incrementally on previous implementations
- Infrastructure tasks (1-3) must be completed before service implementation
- Knowledge Base setup (2) is critical for all subsequent document and chat functionality
- Backend services (4-9) must be functional before frontend development
- Integration and testing tasks (17-19) require all previous tasks to be complete

### Quality Assurance
- Each task must include proper error handling and logging
- All code must follow AWS best practices and security guidelines
- Performance considerations must be addressed in each implementation
- Documentation must be updated as features are implemented
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Every task must properly integrate with Bedrock Knowledge Base
- **No Broken Features**: Never mark a task complete if any functionality is broken

## Success Criteria

### TDD Compliance
