# AWS-Only Development and Testing Compliance Review

## Overview

This document outlines the required changes to bring all previously completed tasks into compliance with the new AWS-only development and testing requirements established in the steering document.

## New Requirements Summary

1. **NO LOCAL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING**: All development, testing, and validation must be performed on AWS infrastructure
2. **Architecture Diagrams**: Create architecture diagrams for design clarification where needed
3. **MCP Server Utilization**: Use all available MCP servers where relevant

## Architecture Diagrams Added

The following architecture diagrams have been created and integrated into the design document:

1. **High-Level System Architecture** (`diagram_a6fe90be.png`) - Overall system overview
2. **Complete Data Flow Architecture** (`diagram_8383dc68.png`) - End-to-end data flow
3. **Infrastructure Foundation Architecture** (`diagram_02306125.png`) - Core AWS infrastructure
4. **Authentication System Architecture** (`diagram_6eed0ef8.png`) - Authentication flows
5. **Document Management System Architecture** (`diagram_a2812ac9.png`) - Document processing pipeline
6. **AI Query Service Architecture** (`diagram_4a9e00fc.png`) - AI query processing
7. **React Frontend Architecture** (`diagram_ee99821e.png`) - Frontend components
8. **Real-time Chat Interface Architecture** (`diagram_768befe2.png`) - Chat interface
9. **AWS-Based Testing Architecture** (`diagram_4c762958.png`) - Testing infrastructure
10. **CI/CD Pipeline and Deployment Architecture** (`diagram_da82e3be.png`) - Deployment pipeline
11. **Production Deployment and Monitoring Architecture** (`diagram_97d3970d.png`) - Production environment

## Tasks Requiring AWS Compliance Review

The following tasks were marked as completed but need to be re-validated against AWS-only requirements:

### Task 1: Project Foundation and Development Environment
**Status**: Changed from Completed → In Progress
**Required Actions**:
- Remove any local development setup instructions
- Ensure all development happens on AWS Cloud9 or similar AWS-based IDE
- Update README to reflect AWS-only development approach
- Validate that all environment configurations point to AWS services

### Task 2: AWS Infrastructure Foundation
**Status**: Changed from Completed → In Progress
**Required Actions**:
- **2.1**: Deploy and verify infrastructure on AWS development environment (not local)
- **2.2**: Test authentication flows using deployed AWS Cognito (not local mocks)
- **2.3**: Verify monitoring and logging through actual CloudWatch (not local logs)

### Task 3: Authentication Service
**Status**: Changed from Completed → In Progress
**Required Actions**:
- **3.1**: Deploy Lambda functions to AWS and test with real DynamoDB
- **3.2**: Test API endpoints through deployed API Gateway (not local server)
- **3.3**: Perform end-to-end testing using real AWS services

### Task 4: Document Management System
**Status**: Changed from Completed → In Progress
**Required Actions**:
- **4.1**: Deploy upload functionality to AWS Lambda and test with real S3
- **4.2**: Test document processing pipeline with real S3 events and Lambda triggers
- **4.3**: Validate vector embedding generation using real Bedrock and OpenSearch
- **4.4**: Test API endpoints through deployed AWS infrastructure

### Task 5: AI Query Service
**Status**: 5.1 Changed from Completed → In Progress, 5.2 In Progress
**Required Actions**:
- **5.1**: Deploy semantic search to AWS and test with real OpenSearch and Bedrock
- **5.2**: Complete AI response generation integration with deployed Bedrock Claude

## MCP Server Utilization Plan

### Available MCP Servers to Leverage:
1. **AWS Documentation MCP**: For accessing AWS service documentation and best practices
2. **AWS Diagram MCP**: For generating additional architecture diagrams as needed
3. **Bedrock Knowledge Base MCP**: For querying AWS knowledge bases and AI/ML guidance
4. **EKS MCP**: For any Kubernetes-related components (if applicable)
5. **Terraform MCP**: For infrastructure validation and optimization
6. **Fetch MCP**: For accessing external documentation and resources

### Implementation Strategy:
- Use AWS Documentation MCP before implementing each AWS service integration
- Leverage Bedrock Knowledge Base MCP for AI/ML implementation guidance
- Utilize Terraform MCP for infrastructure validation (if using Terraform alongside Serverless)
- Use Fetch MCP to access external libraries and framework documentation

## Deployment and Testing Strategy

### AWS-Only Development Environment:
1. **Development Environment**: AWS development account with isolated resources
2. **Testing Environment**: Real AWS services with test data isolation
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions deploying to AWS environments
4. **Monitoring**: Real CloudWatch metrics and logs

### Testing Approach:
1. **Unit Testing**: Deploy test Lambda functions to AWS for execution
2. **Integration Testing**: Test real AWS service interactions
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user workflows through deployed infrastructure
4. **Performance Testing**: Load testing on deployed AWS services
5. **Security Testing**: Penetration testing on deployed infrastructure

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Complete current task 5.2 (AI response generation) with AWS deployment
2. **Priority 1**: Re-validate Task 1 (Project Foundation) for AWS-only compliance
3. **Priority 2**: Re-validate Task 2 (Infrastructure) with actual AWS deployment testing
4. **Priority 3**: Re-validate Task 3 (Authentication) with deployed AWS services
5. **Priority 4**: Re-validate Task 4 (Document Management) with real AWS pipeline
6. **Priority 5**: Complete Task 5 (AI Query Service) with full AWS deployment

## Success Criteria

Each task will be considered compliant when:
- All code is deployed to AWS Lambda functions
- All testing is performed against real AWS services
- No local development tools or mocked services are used
- Architecture diagrams are referenced in design documentation
- Relevant MCP servers are utilized for implementation guidance
- CloudWatch logs show successful execution of all components
- End-to-end workflows function correctly through deployed AWS infrastructure

## Risk Mitigation

- **Cost Management**: Use AWS development account with budget alerts
- **Security**: Implement proper IAM roles and policies for test environments
- **Data Isolation**: Ensure test data doesn't interfere with production
- **Rollback Strategy**: Maintain ability to rollback deployments if issues occur
