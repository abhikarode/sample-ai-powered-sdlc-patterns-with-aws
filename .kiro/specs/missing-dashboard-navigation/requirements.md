# Missing Dashboard Navigation Requirements

## Introduction

Users cannot navigate back to the homepage/dashboard when they are on other pages (like the chat page) because there is no visible "Dashboard" or "Home" navigation link in the sidebar. This creates a poor user experience where users get stuck on specific pages without a clear way to return to the main dashboard.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user on any page of the application, I want to see a "Dashboard" navigation link in the sidebar, so that I can easily return to the homepage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the sidebar THEN they SHALL see a "Dashboard" navigation item as the first menu option
2. WHEN a user clicks the Dashboard navigation item THEN the system SHALL navigate them to the homepage (/)
3. WHEN a user is on the homepage THEN the Dashboard navigation item SHALL be visually highlighted as active
4. WHEN a user is on any other page THEN the Dashboard navigation item SHALL be visible and clickable

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Dashboard navigation to be consistently visible across all pages, so that I always have a way to return to the main overview.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on the chat page THEN they SHALL see the Dashboard navigation link
2. WHEN a user is on the documents page THEN they SHALL see the Dashboard navigation link
3. WHEN a user is on the admin pages THEN they SHALL see the Dashboard navigation link
4. WHEN the sidebar is displayed THEN the Dashboard link SHALL be the topmost navigation item

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Dashboard navigation link to have proper visual styling and iconography, so that it's easily recognizable and consistent with the application design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Dashboard navigation item is displayed THEN it SHALL have a home icon
2. WHEN the Dashboard navigation item is displayed THEN it SHALL have the label "Dashboard"
3. WHEN the Dashboard navigation item is active THEN it SHALL have highlighted styling (purple gradient background)
4. WHEN the Dashboard navigation item is inactive THEN it SHALL have standard styling (white/gray text)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the Dashboard navigation is properly implemented in the React component, so that it renders correctly and functions as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Sidebar component renders THEN it SHALL include the Dashboard navigation item in the navigationItems array
2. WHEN the Dashboard navigation item is rendered THEN it SHALL use the correct ROUTES.HOME path
3. WHEN the user role filtering is applied THEN the Dashboard item SHALL be visible for both 'admin' and 'user' roles
4. WHEN the navigation items are mapped THEN the Dashboard item SHALL appear first in the list
