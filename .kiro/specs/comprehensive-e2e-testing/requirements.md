# Comprehensive End-to-End Testing Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines comprehensive end-to-end functionality testing for the AI Assistant application. The current testing approach is insufficient and lacks true functional validation of user workflows. This specification addresses the need for complete user journey testing that validates all functionality works correctly from the user's perspective.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete User Journey Testing

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive end-to-end tests that validate complete user workflows, so that I can ensure the application functions correctly for real users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL load without errors and display the login interface
2. WHEN a user completes the registration process THEN the system SHALL create the account and allow immediate login
3. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and redirect to the dashboard
4. WHEN a user navigates between sections THEN the system SHALL update the URL and display the correct content
5. WHEN a user uploads a document THEN the system SHALL process the file and make it available for querying
6. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL return relevant AI-generated responses with source citations
7. WHEN an admin user accesses admin functions THEN the system SHALL display administrative interfaces and allow management operations

### Requirement 2: Real Backend Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that validate real backend functionality, so that I can ensure the deployed system works correctly with actual AWS services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL use the actual deployed backend APIs, not mocks
2. WHEN document upload is tested THEN the system SHALL actually upload files to S3 and process them
3. WHEN chat functionality is tested THEN the system SHALL make real calls to Bedrock and OpenSearch
4. WHEN authentication is tested THEN the system SHALL use real Cognito authentication
5. WHEN admin functions are tested THEN the system SHALL interact with real DynamoDB and administrative APIs
6. WHEN error scenarios are tested THEN the system SHALL handle real API failures and network issues

### Requirement 3: Cross-Browser and Device Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work consistently across different browsers and devices, so that I can access it from any platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL validate functionality on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers
2. WHEN responsive design is tested THEN the system SHALL function correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
3. WHEN touch interactions are tested THEN the system SHALL respond correctly to touch gestures on mobile devices
4. WHEN keyboard navigation is tested THEN the system SHALL be fully accessible via keyboard
5. WHEN accessibility features are tested THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Requirement 4: Performance and Load Testing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure the application performs well under realistic load conditions, so that users have a good experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN page load performance is tested THEN pages SHALL load within 3 seconds on standard connections
2. WHEN API response times are tested THEN responses SHALL complete within 10 seconds for complex queries
3. WHEN concurrent user testing is performed THEN the system SHALL handle at least 50 simultaneous users
4. WHEN document processing is tested THEN large files SHALL process within 2 minutes
5. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the frontend SHALL not exceed 100MB memory consumption

### Requirement 5: Data Integrity and Security Testing

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want assurance that my data is handled securely and correctly, so that I can trust the system with sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is tested THEN unauthorized users SHALL NOT access protected resources
2. WHEN role-based access is tested THEN users SHALL only access features appropriate to their role
3. WHEN data persistence is tested THEN uploaded documents and chat history SHALL be retained correctly
4. WHEN session management is tested THEN sessions SHALL expire appropriately and require re-authentication
5. WHEN input validation is tested THEN the system SHALL reject malicious or invalid inputs

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Recovery Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I understand what's happening when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL show user-friendly error messages, not technical details
3. WHEN file upload fails THEN the system SHALL indicate the failure and allow retry
4. WHEN AI responses fail THEN the system SHALL notify the user and suggest alternatives
5. WHEN the system recovers from errors THEN it SHALL return to a functional state without requiring page refresh

### Requirement 7: Automated Test Execution and Reporting

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want automated tests that run reliably and provide clear reports, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL run automatically without manual intervention
2. WHEN tests complete THEN they SHALL generate detailed reports with screenshots and logs
3. WHEN tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear information about the failure cause and location
4. WHEN tests run in CI/CD THEN they SHALL integrate with the deployment pipeline
5. WHEN test results are reviewed THEN they SHALL include performance metrics and coverage information

### Requirement 8: Real-World Scenario Testing

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want tests that simulate realistic user behavior, so that I can be confident the application works for actual use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user workflows are tested THEN they SHALL include realistic document types and sizes
2. WHEN chat interactions are tested THEN they SHALL use realistic questions and conversation patterns
3. WHEN admin workflows are tested THEN they SHALL simulate realistic administrative tasks
4. WHEN multi-user scenarios are tested THEN they SHALL validate concurrent user interactions
5. WHEN edge cases are tested THEN they SHALL include boundary conditions and unusual inputs

### Requirement 9: Continuous Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want continuous monitoring of application functionality, so that I can detect issues before users report them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring tests run THEN they SHALL execute continuously against the production environment
2. WHEN functionality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL notify the team with specific metrics
4. WHEN critical paths fail THEN the system SHALL escalate alerts appropriately
5. WHEN issues are resolved THEN the system SHALL confirm functionality restoration

### Requirement 10: Test Data Management and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want proper test data management, so that tests are reliable and don't interfere with each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests create data THEN they SHALL clean up after completion
2. WHEN tests use shared resources THEN they SHALL not interfere with other tests
3. WHEN test data is needed THEN it SHALL be created programmatically, not manually
4. WHEN tests run repeatedly THEN they SHALL produce consistent results
5. WHEN test environments are reset THEN they SHALL return to a known clean state
