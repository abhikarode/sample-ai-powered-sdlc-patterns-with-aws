# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the AI Assistant Knowledge Base project by removing external libraries that can be replaced with native implementations or compile-time optimizations. The goal is to reduce bundle size, improve security, enhance performance, and minimize the attack surface by eliminating unnecessary runtime dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to minimize external dependencies so that the application has a smaller bundle size and faster load times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing frontend dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify libraries that can be replaced with native implementations
2. WHEN removing external libraries THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality
3. WHEN implementing native alternatives THEN the system SHALL ensure performance is equal or better than the original libraries
4. WHEN optimizing dependencies THEN the system SHALL reduce the total bundle size by at least 30%

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to reduce the number of external dependencies so that the application has a smaller attack surface and fewer supply chain risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN removing external libraries THEN the system SHALL eliminate potential security vulnerabilities from third-party code
2. WHEN implementing native alternatives THEN the system SHALL follow secure coding practices
3. WHEN replacing libraries THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve the security posture
4. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL document security improvements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want to replace animation libraries with CSS animations so that animations are more performant and don't require JavaScript runtime overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replacing framer-motion THEN the system SHALL implement equivalent animations using CSS
2. WHEN using CSS animations THEN the system SHALL support reduced motion preferences for accessibility
3. WHEN implementing animations THEN the system SHALL achieve 60fps performance
4. WHEN creating animation utilities THEN the system SHALL provide reusable animation classes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace icon libraries with inline SVG components so that only used icons are included in the bundle and icons can be customized via CSS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replacing lucide-react THEN the system SHALL create custom SVG icon components
2. WHEN implementing SVG icons THEN the system SHALL support size, color, and className customization
3. WHEN using SVG components THEN the system SHALL enable tree-shaking to include only used icons
4. WHEN creating icons THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling and accessibility attributes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace utility libraries with native implementations so that the application doesn't depend on external packages for simple functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replacing js-cookie THEN the system SHALL implement native cookie management utilities
2. WHEN implementing native utilities THEN the system SHALL provide secure defaults
3. WHEN creating utility functions THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling
4. WHEN replacing libraries THEN the system SHALL maintain API compatibility where possible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to optimize Lambda function dependencies so that cold start times are minimized and deployment packages are smaller.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing Lambda dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify optimization opportunities
2. WHEN optimizing AWS SDK usage THEN the system SHALL use specific client imports only
3. WHEN bundling Lambda functions THEN the system SHALL minimize package size
4. WHEN deploying functions THEN the system SHALL achieve faster cold start times

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize build-time dependencies so that development builds are faster and the CI/CD pipeline is more efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing devDependencies THEN the system SHALL identify unused or redundant packages
2. WHEN optimizing build tools THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve build performance
3. WHEN updating build configuration THEN the system SHALL enable better tree-shaking
4. WHEN removing dev dependencies THEN the system SHALL ensure all build processes continue to work

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation of the cleanup process so that the changes are maintainable and the benefits are clear.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing the cleanup THEN the system SHALL document all changes made
2. WHEN removing libraries THEN the system SHALL document the native alternatives implemented
3. WHEN measuring improvements THEN the system SHALL provide before/after metrics
4. WHEN documenting changes THEN the system SHALL include migration guides for future developers
