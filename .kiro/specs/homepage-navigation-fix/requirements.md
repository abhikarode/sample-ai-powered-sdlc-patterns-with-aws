# Homepage Navigation Fix Requirements

## Introduction

Users are unable to navigate back to the homepage when they are on the chat page, creating a poor user experience where users get "stuck" on specific pages without a clear way to return to the main dashboard.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user on the chat page, I want to be able to navigate back to the homepage/dashboard, so that I can access other features and see the main overview.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on the chat page THEN they SHALL see a clearly visible "Dashboard" or "Home" navigation option
2. WHEN a user clicks the Dashboard/Home navigation option THEN the system SHALL navigate them to the homepage (/)
3. WHEN a user navigates to the homepage THEN they SHALL see the main dashboard content
4. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the URL SHALL update correctly to reflect the current page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user on any page of the application, I want consistent navigation options, so that I can easily move between different sections of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on any page THEN they SHALL see the same navigation menu/sidebar
2. WHEN a user clicks any navigation item THEN the system SHALL navigate to the correct page
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the active page SHALL be visually indicated in the navigation
4. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the navigation SHALL remain accessible and functional

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation to work reliably across different browsers and devices, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of how I access the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) THEN navigation SHALL work consistently
2. WHEN using mobile devices THEN navigation SHALL be accessible and functional
3. WHEN JavaScript is enabled THEN all navigation links SHALL work properly
4. WHEN there are network issues THEN navigation SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the navigation system is properly implemented with React Router, so that the application follows modern SPA best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing navigation THEN the system SHALL use React Router Link components
2. WHEN navigation occurs THEN browser history SHALL be properly managed
3. WHEN users use browser back/forward buttons THEN navigation SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the correct page SHALL be displayed based on the URL
