# Requirements Document - Sidebar Navigation Fix

## Introduction

This specification addresses a navigation bug in the AI Assistant application where the sidebar navigation menu is incorrectly linking to `/admin` instead of `/admin/dashboard`. This causes users to land on a non-functional admin page instead of the intended admin dashboard with full functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the sidebar navigation to direct me to the correct admin dashboard page, so that I can access all administrative functions without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user clicks the "Admin" link in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL navigate to `/admin/dashboard`
2. WHEN the navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL display the full admin dashboard with metrics and management functions
3. WHEN the user is on the admin dashboard THEN the sidebar SHALL show the "Admin" link as active/selected

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the routing constants to be used consistently throughout the application, so that navigation links point to the correct destinations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar component renders the admin link THEN it SHALL use `ROUTES.ADMIN_DASHBOARD` constant instead of `ROUTES.ADMIN`
2. WHEN the routing constants are defined THEN `ROUTES.ADMIN_DASHBOARD` SHALL point to `/admin/dashboard`
3. WHEN the routing constants are defined THEN `ROUTES.ADMIN` SHALL point to `/admin` (for potential future use)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent navigation behavior across the application, so that I can predict where links will take me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any navigation component references admin functionality THEN it SHALL use the correct route constant
2. WHEN the fix is implemented THEN all existing navigation patterns SHALL remain unchanged except for the admin link
3. WHEN the application loads THEN no navigation links SHALL point to non-functional pages
