- âœ… Navigation between pages functional

### 13. TDD Compliance

**Red-Green-Refactor Cycle Followed:**
- âœ… **RED**: Tests written first for expected functionality
- âœ… **GREEN**: Minimal implementation to pass tests
- âœ… **REFACTOR**: Code optimized while maintaining test coverage
- âœ… **AWS TESTING**: All tests run against real deployed infrastructure

**No Mocking of AWS Services:**
- âœ… All API calls target real AWS endpoints
- âœ… Authentication uses real Cognito User Pool
- âœ… Document storage uses real S3 bucket
- âœ… Knowledge Base integration with real Bedrock service

## Conclusion

Task 13 has been successfully completed with a fully functional document management interface that:

1. **Follows TDD principles** with comprehensive testing
2. **Integrates with real AWS services** (no mocking)
3. **Provides complete document lifecycle management**
4. **Includes Knowledge Base sync status monitoring**
5. **Implements proper error handling and user feedback**
6. **Supports role-based access control**
7. **Offers responsive design for multiple devices**
8. **Maintains high code quality with TypeScript**

The implementation is ready for production use and provides a seamless experience for users to upload, manage, and monitor documents in the AI Assistant Knowledge Base system.

### Next Steps

The document management interface is now complete and ready for users to:
- Upload documents to the Knowledge Base
